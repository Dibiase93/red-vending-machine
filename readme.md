# Vending Machine

This is a project to test TDD (test driven development) skills.

## Installation instructions

Clone the repo, and install jest librart by running:
npm install --save-dev jest-cli

### Learning Curve

This was a great project to learn hands on, how TDD is so valuable.
I had issues understanding exactly how to test certain things. I learned that it's best to test the values returned.
